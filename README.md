###### Bread halwa is my favourite food.

Bread is probably one of the few ingredients that never fail to disappoint me. It is so versatile in character that you can use it in many ways to create delightful dishes. One of my recent favourites is Bread Halwa.sweet treat can be hard to picture, but take a spoonful of the dessert and I bet you will come back for seconds.
